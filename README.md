# tipy

## A more tasteful, comfortable C.

> Tipy is a statically-typed, compiled programming language, designed with a core philosophy: to be a **more tasteful, comfortable C**.

`tipy` aims to fuse the low-level control and performance of C with the ergonomics and safety of modern languages. I want to provide a more expressive and less error-prone programming experience while retaining low-level features like manual memory management.

Say goodbye to header files (`#include <headache.h>`), say goodbye to `NULL` and dangling pointers. `tipy` is dedicated to providing a unique, concise, and consistent "taste".

## ‚ú® Project Status

**Current Version: v0.0.1-alpha**

This project is in its early alpha stage of development. I have just reached a major milestone:

* ‚úÖ **v0.0.1**: Successfully achieved end-to-end compilation for a "Hello, World!" program!
    * Hand-written a lexer and parser to build an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
    * Generated functional LLVM IR via `inkwell` (a Rust wrapper for LLVM).
    * Successfully compiled and linked the LLVM IR into a native executable.

## üëã Hello, Tipy World!

This is what `tipy` looks like in v0.0.1:

```tipy
// hello.tp
main() {
    print("Hello, Tipy World!")
}
```

My compiler (`tipyc`) will compile the code above into the following LLVM Intermediate Representation (IR):

```llvm
; ModuleID = 'tipy_module'
source_filename = "tipy_module"

@.str = private unnamed_addr constant [19 x i8] c"Hello,Tipy World!\00", align 1

declare i32 @puts(ptr)

define i32 @main() {
entry:
  %tmp_call = call i32 @puts(ptr @.str)
  ret i32 0
}
```

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap

I am moving towards the `v0.1.0` target, with plans to implement the following core features:

* [x] **v0.0.1: Hello, World!** (Completed)
* [ ] **Variable System**: Variable declarations, assignments, and default immutability (`~` for mutable).
* [ ] **Primitive Types**: Integers, floats, booleans, chars, strings.
* [ ] **Control Flow**: `if-else` expressions, `loop`, `while`.
* [ ] **Functions**: Full function definitions, parameters, and return values.
* [ ] **Classes & Enums**: Initial definitions for `class` and `enum`.
* [ ] **Memory Management**: Manual memory management (`new`, `free`) with related safety guarantees.
* [ ] **Pointers**: The unique `^` pointer syntax and type system.

## üöÄ Building and Running (v0.0.1)

**Prerequisites:**
1.  **Rust Toolchain**: Install it from [rust-lang.org](https://rust-lang.org).
2.  **LLVM Toolchain**: A version matching the `inkwell` dependency is required. This project currently uses **LLVM 18**.
    ```bash
    # Example for Ubuntu
    sudo apt install llvm-18 clang-18
    ```

**Build and Run Steps:**

1.  **Run Your Compiler**:
    This step compiles and runs `tipyc` itself. It will read the built-in "Hello, World!" source code and generate an `output.ll` file.
    ```bash
    cargo run
    ```

2.  **Compile LLVM IR to an Object File**:
    Use `llc` to convert the human-readable IR into a binary object file.
    ```bash
    llc-18 -filetype=obj -relocation-model=pic -o output.o output.ll
    ```

3.  **Link into an Executable**:
    Use `clang` to link your object file with the system's C standard library (where the `puts` function lives).
    ```bash
    clang-18 output.o -o my_program
    ```

4.  **Run your first tipy program!**
    ```bash
    ./my_program
    # Output: Hello, Tipy World!
    ```
